# Detecting-Tree-Logging-Sounds-using-Deep-Learning
This project aimed to tackle deforestation head-on by developing a real-time system for detecting tree logging sounds using deep learning, it leveraged a diverse audio dataset featuring chainsaw, axe knocking, handsaw noises, and ambient forest sounds (birds, animals) which was acquired in real-time from forests recording various logging sounds and background noise, which ultimately contained six audio classes. Various signal processing techniques were employed using Python's Librosa framework and extracted multiple features, such as MFCC's, to characterize the unique acoustics of logging activities. Multiple deep learning models were trained using keras and tensorflow frameworks of python and these were tested using classification metrics to get the best-performing model.
